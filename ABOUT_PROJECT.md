# The CORE-AGE Protocol: Ontological Engineering in the Era of Recursive Generation

### Executive Summary
The **CORE-AGE** project (Computational Ontology, Recursive Ecology, Agentic GEneration) represents a paradigm shift in spatial computing. Spearheaded by **Watson Hartsoe** at Georgia Tech, it seeks to solve the "crisis of the object" in digital media by imposing rigorous semantic structures upon generative workflows.

This protocol analyzes the project's **Repository Manifests**—constitutional documents that govern the birth and behavior of digital objects. It synthesizes the project's practical systems—**WAG**, **GAR**, and **MENTO**—with a robust theoretical framework drawing from David Spivak’s *Category Theory*, Yuk Hui’s *Philosophy of Digital Objects*, and Hannes Bajohr’s concept of *Operative Ekphrasis*.

## 1. The Genesis: From Governance to Generation

### 1.1 The Architect: Watson Hartsoe
The structural ambitions of the CORE-AGE project are rooted in the trajectory of its lead researcher, **Watson Hartsoe**. Currently a PhD student in Digital Media at Georgia Tech, Hartsoe’s work focuses on **Virtual Placemaking** and the intersection of narrative and geometry. 
- **Governance**: His background (Sewanee Honor Council) suggests a deep concern for integrity, translated here into "Data Integrity" and "Ontological Consistency."
- **Portfolio**: Projects like *Future Oceans* and *Hubs Cloud* demonstrate a commitment to immersive, participatory environments. CORE-AGE synthesizes these interests, using computational tools to address the compelling concerns of human inhabitants.

## 2. Theoretical Pillars

### Pillar I: Operative Ekphrasis ("Words Become Worlds")
Drawing from **Hannes Bajohr**, CORE-AGE redefines text in digital systems not as description, but as **operation**.
- **The Collapse**: In generative AI, the distinction between the "word" (prompt) and the "world" (object) collapses. Text is the causal agent.
- **WAG System**: **Words Assemble Geometry** is the practical implementation. It translates natural language into LDraw/GLB geometry, ensuring the resulting world is a rigorous translation of intent, not a hallucination.

### Pillar II: The Ontology Log ("Building Code")
To prevent unbounded chaos, the system employs **Ologs** (David Spivak/Robert Kent).
- **Structure**: Knowledge is structured as a Category where Objects are "Types" and Arrows are "Functional Relationships."
- **Trail Olog**: The `courage-trail-olog.html` acts as the topographic map. It validates that the relationships between entities (e.g., `Player → has → Goal`) adhere to the **Project Genome**.
- **Commutative Diagrams**: Facts are verified by checking if different paths through the graph yield the same result (e.g., `Woman → Mother` vs `Woman → Parent`).

### Pillar III: Digital Existence ("The Repository Manifest")
Drawing from **Yuk Hui**, the project argues that digital objects must have "Existential Relations," not just metadata.
- **The Manifest**: `file-manifest.json` serves as the Constitution. It tracks the provenance/birth of every artifact.
- **Tertiary Protention**: The repository does not just store the past; it seeds the future, allowing for recursive generation that remains ontologically grounded.

## 3. The Verified System Architecture

Contrary to earlier interpretations, the CORE-AGE stack is defined by three specific, interlocked tools:

### GAR: Grid Assembles Reality
*Refuting the "Galactic Arms Race" Interpretation*
While sharing an acronym with other systems, **GAR** in this context stands for **Grid Assembles Reality**.
- **Function**: A visual analysis engine using K-Means clustering to segment images into semantic narrative graphs.
- **Ontology**: The "Eye" of the system, translating pixels into Categories (Entity, Goal, Obstacle).

### MENTO: Cinematography & Path Planning
*Refuting the "OCR Glitch" Theory*
**MENTO** is a sophisticated 3D cinematography tool ("Mento Master"), not a glitch.
- **Function**: Defines camera paths, shots, and frustums (`mento-385.html`).
- **Role**: Handles the **Temporal** aspect (Time/Attention) of the spatial stack.

### WAG: The Synthesis Engine
**Words Assemble Geometry** connects the linguistic logic of the Olog to the spatial reality of the Grid.
- **Role**: The Bridge between **Word** (Operative Ekphrasis) and **World** (Geometry).

## 4. Media Ecologies
The friction between the rigid logic of the Olog and the fluid generation of AI creates a **Media Ecology** (Matthew Fuller). The "Repository Manifest" acts as the stabilizer, ensuring that the "mutability of media objects" does not degenerate into incoherence. By enforcing **LDraw standards**, the system inherits a "community geometry" that acts as a stable substrate.

## Conclusion: The Protocol of the Future
CORE-AGE is a rigorous attempt to engineer a "Constitution" for virtual worlds.
- **WAG** (Space)
- **GAR** (Ontology)
- **MENTO** (Time)

These form a complete ontological stack, ensuring that words do not just describe worlds—they assemble, validate, and inhabit them.
