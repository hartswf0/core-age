# CORE-AGE: Words Become Worlds
### Operative Ekphrasis & Spatial Computing Research

**CORE-AGE** is a multidisciplinary research initiative exploring the intersection of Computational Ontology, Recursive Ecology, and Agentic Generation. Spearheaded by **Watson Hartsoe**, the project seeks to solve the "crisis of the object" in digital media by imposing strict ontological structures upon generative workflows.

## Core Theoretical Frameworks

### 1. The Repository Manifest (Constitutional Reality)
Drawing from **Yuk Hui's *On the Existence of Digital Objects***, the project posits that digital entities must be defined not just by metadata, but by their existential relations. The **Repository Manifest** (`file-manifest.json`) serves as the "constitution" of this reality, tracking the provenance and "birth" of every artifact in the system.

### 2. Ologs (Ontology Logs)
Utilizing **David Spivak's Category Theory**, the system maps knowledge relationships (e.g., `Creator → Generates → Artifact`) to ensure logical consistency. This is visualized in the **Trail Olog** (`courage-trail-olog.html`), a topographic map of the project's creative history.

### 3. Words Become Worlds
Inspired by semantic analysis (and the concept of "Operative Ekphrasis"), the project treats language as a construction material for 3D space. This is realized in the **WAG (Words Assemble Geometry)** system, where narrative text is directly translated into spatial layouts.

## Key Systems (Verified)

### GAR (Grid Assembles Reality)
*Refuting the "Galactic Arms Race" interpretation.*
**GAR** is a visual analysis engine that segments images into semantic narrative graphs using K-Means clustering and grid-based logic. It translates pixels into "Entities," "Goals," and "Obstacles."
- **Reference**: `gar-tao-explainer.html`

### MENTO (Cinematography & Path Planning)
*Refuting the "OCR Glitch" theory.*
**MENTO** is a sophisticated 3D cinematography tool ("Mento Master") for defining camera paths, shots, and frustums within the GLB environments. It handles the "temporal" aspect of the spatial computing stack.

### WAG (Words Assemble Geometry)
The central synthesis engine that connects the "Word" (LLM output) to the "World" (LDraw/GLB geometry).

## Novel Research Contributions

### 1. The Categorical Duality of Vision & Narrative (𝒱 ≃ ℕᵒᵖ)
*Novel Theoretical Framework*
Contrary to traditional multi-modal models that treat image and text as separate embeddings, CORE-AGE demonstrates that **Visual Segmentation (𝒱)** and **Narrative Ontology (ℕ)** are categorically dual.
- **Insight**: Visual "boundaries" (edges) map inversely to Narrative "relations" (connections).
- **Formalism**: We establish a bidirectional **Functor** where *Warm Colors* (Hue 0-60°) map to *Goals* (Narrative Attractors) and *Cool Colors* (Hue 180-300°) map to *Shifts* (Narrative Transitions).
- **Citation**: Extends **Spivak, D. (2014)** *Category Theory for the Sciences* into the domain of computational narratology.

### 2. Spatial Downsampling as Natural Transformation
*Non-Obvious Technical Implementation*
The compression of the 20×20 Visual Grid (GAR) into the 9×9 Narrative Grid (ONYX) is not merely a lossy jpeg-like operation. It is implemented as a **Natural Transformation** ($η$) that preserves the topological invariants (adjacency, containment) of the original scene.
- **Result**: A "low-res" story graph that mathematically guarantees the preservation of the original image's structural semantics.

### 3. Operative Ekphrasis via "Speech Acts"
*Methodological Innovation*
The WAG System redefines "Prompt Engineering" as **Operative Ekphrasis**.
- **Theory**: Drawing from **J.L. Austin's** *Speech Act Theory*, WAG treats LLM outputs not as "descriptions" of a scene, but as *performative utterances* that instantiate 3D geometry (LDraw).
- **Contribution**: A pivot from "Generative AI as Author" to "Generative AI as Architect," where words literally become worlds through a rigorous ontological compiler.
