# CORE-AGE: Words Become Worlds
### Operative Ekphrasis & Spatial Computing Research

**CORE-AGE** is a multidisciplinary research initiative exploring the intersection of Computational Ontology, Recursive Ecology, and Agentic Generation. Spearheaded by **Watson Hartsoe**, the project seeks to solve the "crisis of the object" in digital media by imposing strict ontological structures upon generative workflows.

## Core Theoretical Frameworks

### 1. The Repository Manifest (Constitutional Reality)
Drawing from **Yuk Hui's *On the Existence of Digital Objects***, the project posits that digital entities must be defined not just by metadata, but by their existential relations. The **Repository Manifest** (`file-manifest.json`) serves as the "constitution" of this reality, tracking the provenance and "birth" of every artifact in the system.

### 2. Ologs (Ontology Logs)
Utilizing **David Spivak's Category Theory**, the system maps knowledge relationships (e.g., `Creator → Generates → Artifact`) to ensure logical consistency. This is visualized in the **Trail Olog** (`courage-trail-olog.html`), a topographic map of the project's creative history.

### 3. Words Become Worlds
Inspired by semantic analysis (and the concept of "Operative Ekphrasis"), the project treats language as a construction material for 3D space. This is realized in the **WAG (Words Assemble Geometry)** system, where narrative text is directly translated into spatial layouts.

## Key Systems (Verified)

### GAR (Grid Assembles Reality)
*Refuting the "Galactic Arms Race" interpretation.*
**GAR** is a visual analysis engine that segments images into semantic narrative graphs using K-Means clustering and grid-based logic. It translates pixels into "Entities," "Goals," and "Obstacles."

### MENTO (Cinematography & Path Planning)
*Refuting the "OCR Glitch" theory.*
**MENTO** is a sophisticated 3D cinematography tool ("Mento Master") for defining camera paths, shots, and frustums within the GLB environments. It handles the "temporal" aspect of the spatial computing stack.

### WAG (Words Assemble Geometry)
The central synthesis engine that connects the "Word" (LLM output) to the "World" (LDraw/GLB geometry).

## Summary of Hallucinations Detected & Removed
* The following concepts from the generated report were **excluded** as they do not appear in the verifiable codebase:
    * "Galactic Arms Race" (Video Game Reference)
    * "Omertà Unbroken" (Card Game)
    * "Gumball Emotion Machine" (Biometric Project)
    * "Mento as an OCR Glitch" (Incorrect Etymology)
    * "Future Oceans / Hubs Cloud" (Likely prior work not in this repo)
