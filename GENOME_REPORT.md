# 🧬 Genome: CORE-AGE (Deep Sequence)

**Sequenced**: 2025-12-11 | **Arc**: LEGOS → WAG → TRAIL | **Identity**: Spatial Epistemology

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New Interactive Viewer Available**
> The full genome data is now rendered dynamically in [courage-genome.html](courage-genome.html).
> It pulls real-time data from `courage-trail-data.json`, ensuring the report matches the visualization.

## 🏛️ The Three Ages (Trail Map)

This repository is not just "WAG". It preserves three distinct geological eras of development:

### 1. The LEGO Era (The "Line 22" Phase)
> *Focus: LDraw Parsing, Mesh Optimization, Assembly Logic*
- **Artifacts**: `lego-3d-architect.html`, `timber-master.html`, `wag-viewer-prime-integration...`
- **Key Event: The "Line 22 Collapse"**
    - A critical failure where monolithic mesh loading destroyed lineage data.
    - **Decision**: Shifted from "Blob Load" (Arch A) to **"Mesh-Per-Line" (Arch B)**.
    - **Result**: Validated the principle that *provenance > performance*.

### 2. The Tetrad Era (The "Disentangling" Phase)
> *Focus: McLuhan's Laws, Ontological Mapping, 9x9 Grids*
- **Artifacts**: `thousand-tetrad.html`, `gar-tao.html`, `disentangling-strategy.html`
- **Pattern**: **The Tetrad** (Enhance, Reverse, Retrieve, Obsolesce) became the sorting algorithm for all knowledge.
- **Invention**: **GAR** (Grid-Aware Recursion) — the 9x9 invariant substrate.

### 3. The WAG Era (Current Synthesis)
> *Focus: Words Become Worlds, Narrative Ontology*
- **Artifacts**: `wag-workshop.html`, `gar-onyx-studio.html`, `courage-trail-olog.html`
- **Synthesis**: Merged the "Mesh-Per-Line" precision of LEGO with the "Grid Logic" of Tetrads to create **Operative Ekphrasis**.

## 🔍 Deep Patterns Detected

### 1. "Autopsy Culture"
The repository contains detailed post-mortems of failures (e.g., `line-22-autopsy.html`). The creator treats bugs as *pathologies* to be dissected, not just fixed.

### 2. "Invariant Substrate" (The 9x9 Grid)
From `grid-walk.html` to `gar-tao.html`, the **Grid** is constant. It is the repository's "physics engine"—everything must map to it.

### 3. "Fractal Tooling"
New tools are built *inside* the debris of old ones. `wag-viewer-prime` contains the seeds of `gar-onyx-studio`.

**Status**: Deep Sequencing Complete. The "Ghost Layers" (LEGO, Tetrad) are now mapped.
