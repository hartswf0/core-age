# Toward a Spatial Ontology of Narrative: The ONYX Experiments

**Status:** Research Statement / Synthesis
**Date:** December 2025
**Subject:** Reifying Narrative Structure through Spatial Interfaces

---

## Abstract

We are transitioning from **Text Editors** (linear, 1D processing) to **Structural Editors** (spatial, topological processing). The ONYX experiments demonstrate that complex narrative systems—specifically multi-agent simulations and branching storylines—cannot be adequately modeled using linear text alone. Instead, they require a **Spatial Ontology**: a set of atomic units (Entities, Cores, Morphisms) that exist within a defined topology (The Grid).

This research statement summarizes four distinct experimental interfaces ("projections") developed to explore this hypothesis.

## The Four Projections

### 1. ONYX Reactor (`onyx-remade.html`)
**The Hypothesis:** *Code and Narrative share an isomorphic structure.*

The Reactor experiment treats narrative text and executable code as interchangeable substrates. It introduces the **Code Decomposer**, which parses syntax (`function`, `class`, `const`) and maps it directly to ontological categories (Morphism, Core, Entity) on a 9x9 grid.
- **Key Finding:** We can visualize the "shape" of a story just as we visualize the "shape" of a codebase.
- **Metaphor:** Biological/Mechanical ("Muscles", "Tendons").

### 2. ONYX Media (`onyx-media.html`)
**The Hypothesis:** *To think about complex time, we must spatialized it.*

Inspired by Bret Victor's "Media for Thinking the Unthinkable," this experiment explodes the linear narrative into a **Horizontal Timeline** and a **Grid-of-Grids Gallery**. It allows the author to see the state of the world at T0, T1, and T2 simultaneously, rather than remembering previous states.
- **Key Finding:** "Parallel seeing" reduces cognitive load when managing branching narratives (Forks).
- **Metaphor:** Film Editing / Non-Linear Editor (NLE).

### 3. ONYX Builder (`onyx-builder.html`)
**The Hypothesis:** *Narrative construction is a conversational process.*

Building on the `thousand-tetrad` architecture, this experiment embeds the spatial grid *inside* a vertical chat interface. It acknowledges that stories emerge from a dialogue (between author and system, or between agents). It proves that structural editing can be **mobile-first** and conversational.
- **Key Finding:** The "Chat Bubble" can contain worlds. Complex state can be embedded in flow.
- **Metaphor:** Messenger / WeChat for World Building.

### 4. Ontological Ancestor (`onto-ancestor.html`)
**The Hypothesis:** *All narrative atoms exist on a single, unified plane.*

The most recent and advanced experiment. It strips away the timeline and the chat to focus purely on the **Atomic Substrate**. It introduces a "magnetic" 9x9 grid where Nodes (Entities, Goals) snap to discrete positions. It features a "System View" (visual) and "Code View" (JSON) that toggle instantly, proving the duality of the representation.
- **Key Finding:** Direct manipulation (Drag & Drop) with haptic-like snapping is essential for "feeling" the ontology.
- **Metaphor:** Forensic Reconstruction / CAD.

## The Unified Field Theory

What are we showing? We are showing that **Narrative is a Topological Space**.

1.  **The Atoms:** We have defined a consistent ontology across all experiments:
    *   **Core (⚡):** The immutable essence/motivator.
    *   **Entity (👤):** The agent acting in the world.
    *   **Goal (🎯):** The attractor point.
    *   **Obstacle (🚧):** The repulsor/barrier.
    *   **Morphism (🔄):** The transformation function (A → B).
    *   **Shift (⚡):** The state change event.

2.  **The Topology:** The **9x9 Grid** has emerged as the fundamental unit of space. It is small enough to be comprehensible (81 slots) but large enough to hold complex relations.

3.  **The Time:** Time is simply a sequence of these Grids (T0 → T1 → T2), linked by Morphisms.

## Conclusion

We are building a **CAD tool for Stories**. Just as architects use blueprints to manage the complexity of a building, narrative engineers need spatial tools to manage the complexity of multi-agent systems. The ONYX experiments are not just UI mockups; they are proofs-of-concept for a new medium of thought.
